Portfolio Project: Synthea EHR Data Processing and Merging
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a robust data processing pipeline for a synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) dataset generated by Synthea. Unlike working with a single flat file, this project tackles a more realistic challenge: integrating data from multiple, related tables to create a unified patient summary view.

The primary goal is to take raw, separate CSV files for patients, conditions, and encounters, and transform them into a single, clean, and analysis-ready dataset. This showcases key data engineering and preprocessing skills that are essential for any data-focused role in the healthcare industry.

Key Tasks and Skills Demonstrated
Multi-File Data Management: Loading and processing several related CSV files (patients.csv, conditions.csv, encounters.csv) using Python and Pandas.

Data Cleaning and Standardization: Applying data type corrections across multiple files, especially for date and time columns.

Feature Engineering: Creating new, insightful features from the raw data, such as:

Calculating patient Age from birth and death dates.

Creating a binary IsDeceased flag for easier analysis.

Data Aggregation: Using groupby() operations to summarize information from transactional tables (conditions and encounters) into meaningful metrics for each patient (e.g., ConditionCount, EncounterCount).

Data Merging and Joining: Using Pandas merge (equivalent to SQL joins) to combine the cleaned patient data with the aggregated summaries into a final, comprehensive table.

Handling Post-Merge Issues: Cleaning up the merged dataset by filling NaN values that arise from left joins, ensuring data integrity.

How to Run This Project
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.7+

Pip (Python package installer)

A set of Synthea-generated CSV files.

2. Setup
First, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory.

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>

Next, install the necessary Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Step-by-Step Execution
Step 1: Place Your Synthea Data

Download or generate your desired dataset from Synthea. From the output, place the following three files into the root of this project directory:

patients.csv

conditions.csv

encounters.csv

Step 2: Run the Processing Pipeline

Execute the process_synthea_data.py script. This script will automatically load the three CSVs, perform all the cleaning, aggregation, and merging steps, and save the result.

python process_synthea_data.py

4. Output
After the script runs successfully, a new file named synthea_patient_summary.csv will be created. This file contains the consolidated, clean data, with one row per patient, ready for exploratory data analysis, visualization, or machine learning.

Conclusion and Next Steps
This project successfully demonstrates a complete, multi-stage data processing workflow. The final synthea_patient_summary.csv is a valuable asset for subsequent analysis. Possible next steps include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze relationships between the number of conditions, number of encounters, and patient demographics.

Predictive Modeling: Build a machine learning model to predict a patient outcome (e.g., number of future encounters) based on their profile.

Data Visualization: Create a dashboard to visualize the patient population, such as age distribution, prevalence of different races/ethnicities, and more.
